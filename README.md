The repo has useful pytest example demonstrating  pytest elagance in QA automated testing - Api testing, web applications etc..

### Multivation for putting together an API testing framework

##### when testing apis I usually found myself repeating alot test code and I knew this is wrong. I strongly believe that api tests should be:
    - **Test data driven** - scenarios should drive tests.
    - There should be **minimal repetition** on test code. **DRY Principal**
    - **Stand alone** - tests should not depend on each other, or else there should be minimal dependancy.
    - Test **dependancy** comes in handy when testing business logic.
    - Any part of API under test should be **configurable**, i.e remove any hard coding as much as possible.

###### Therefore there is a need to organize test process or flow to ensure that apis tests yield maximum benefits like test accuracy,maintainance and speed.

### **Organization of api framework: process**

  1. setup code(code executed before any test is run).
  2. session management - managing session objects and data.
  3. Test data generation - important for concurrent tests.
  4. parametrizing tests - since the framework is test data driven and need to run tests concurrently.
  5. writting a conftest file e.g fixtures and extra commandline arguments
  6. collecting tests
  7. marking tests - helps to choose which tests to execute.
  8. running tests - concurrent execution of tests for speed.
  9. test reporting - allure, html, and json reports

### prerequisite
